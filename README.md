Student of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the Pontifical Catholic University of SÃ£o Paulo

Since the early years of my academic journey, I've always had a conviction: I would follow the path of statistics, meticulous analysis in search of patterns, and problem-solving. After a long period of exploration and self-discovery, I finally found my place in the field of Data Science and Analysis. This field encompasses all my passions and skills, and it is precisely where I wish to continue to grow and contribute increasingly, committing myself to excellence and continuous advancement in this area.

My experience so far involves academic projects where I applied analytical approaches to solve complex problems. Additionally, I have been honing my skills in Python, as well as data visualization and data manipulation tools.
